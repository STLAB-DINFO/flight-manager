# Flight Manager

Flight Manager is a Web Application accounting the operative context of an online flight booking IT system, available through the Internet.

The platform has been designed to cover functional requirements of three  user classes:
- not registered users (i.e., visitors), exploiting offered services as "one-time" accounts without the need for authentication;
- users with a premium account (i.e., registered), consuming exposed services, only, after a login authentication process;
- administrators (i.e., admins), accessing a reserved area dedicated to managing entities related to "for sale" products (i.e., flight tickets).

Flight Manager has been designed as a classical 3-tier stateful architecture developed through the Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) ecosystem, exploiting following specifications:
- JavaServer Faces (JSF);
- Contexts and Dependency Injection} (CDI);
- Java Persistence API} (JPA).
